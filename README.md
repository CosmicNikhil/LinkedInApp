# Social Network Microservices System

A cloud-native, scalable backend system inspired by social networking platforms. Designed using Spring Boot microservices, this project demonstrates clean service separation, Kafka-based communication, centralized config/log management, and resilient architecture.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### Core Microservices
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles and related operations.
- **Post Service**: Handles creation and retrieval of user posts.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications based on events via Kafka.
- **Connections Service**: Manages connection requests and friend lists.

### Supporting Components
- **API Gateway**: Routes HTTP requests to respective microservices.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration using Spring Cloud Config.
- **Service Registry**: Eureka server for service discovery.
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing to monitor microservice communication.
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
- **Resilience4j Dashboard**: Circuit breaker and fault tolerance visualization.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Java 17, Spring Boot
- Kafka (Event-driven communication)
- Eureka (Service discovery)
- Spring Cloud Config
- Zipkin (Tracing)
- ELK Stack (Logging)
- Resilience4j (Circuit breaking)
- Docker (Containerization)
- Kubernetes (Deployment)
- GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)

## 🚀 Deployment

- All services are containerized using Docker.
- Deployed to **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.
- Persistent volume claims used for stateful services like Kafka.
- Kubernetes services include:
  - `StatefulSets` for databases/brokers
  - `Deployments` for stateless microservices
  - `NodePort/ClusterIP` services for internal/external access

## 🔄 Inter-Service Communication

- REST-based communication via API Gateway
- Asynchronous communication using **Kafka topics** for:
  - Send Connection Request
  - Accept Connection Request
  - New Post Notification

## 🧪 Monitoring & Logging

- Distributed tracing with **Zipkin**
- Centralized logging using **ELK Stack**
- Circuit breaker status and failure tracking using **Resilience4j dashboard**
